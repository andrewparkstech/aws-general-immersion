Labs for AWS General Immersion Day, done in Terraform

### Intro
There are various labs over at AWS General Immersion Day. The one I completed was for EC2 Auto scaling. It walks you through setting it up using the console (GUI) but I decided to use Terraform because:
* I like a challenge
* It's fun

### Authentication
Authentication to AWS for this lab is done via credentials supplied to the AWS command line (local credentials file). Best practice for production is to use AWS Identity Center.
